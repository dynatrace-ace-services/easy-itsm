## ITSM Integration : SLO real time alert 

Goal : be alerting immediatly on application and/or frontend services if there is a risk to miss the SLO.

- Create SLO on appplication or frontend services
- Add SLO alert on Burn Rate
- Add SLO alert on Error Budget
- Create Alerting Profile on SLO alert
- Add ITSM notification without delay     
      - Critical for Burn Rate  
      - Error/Warning for Error Budget  

## ITSM Integration : Persistant alert

Goal : be alerting if the problem is persistant and not fix after X minutes. 

- Create a alerting profile with X min delay (between 15 min to 1 h)
- To define the best delay X min for the production context, you can use the Anton's script.
- Add ITSM Integration based on this alerting profile.

## Others best practices 

- Configure Maintenance Windows to disable the notification of the ITSM integration.
For example, if you know that your application will not be used during Bank Hollidays, create a maintenance window to avoid the alert `Application Low Traffic`

You can do that easily with monaco here (you will find the monaco template for French banck hollidays) :

- Adapt the Disk threshold to your context  
Sometime, you have to adapt the available disk space threshold to you context: 
prefer a global configuration on the tenant with a filter on the entities wit a specific TAG to apply your custom condition :

- Don't modify the thresholds, but leave Davis to deal with his baseline  

- Create the SLO to take advantage of the Burn Rate alerte.
