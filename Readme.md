## ITSM Integration : SLO real time alert 

Goal : be alerting immediatly on application and/or frontend services if there is a risk to miss the SLO.

- Create SLO for main application or main frontend services (but not for all)  
- Add SLO alert on fast burn rate
- Add SLO alert on error budget warning
- Create Alerting Profile on SLO alert
- Add ITSM notification without delay     
      - Critical for Fast Burn Rate  
      - Warning for Slow Burn Rate or Error Budget  


You can use these monaco templates [here](https://github.com/dynatrace-ace-services/easy-itsm-integration/tree/main/template_monaco) 

## ITSM Integration : Persistent problems

Goal : be alerting if the problem is persistant and not fix after X minutes. 

- Create a alerting profile with X min delay (between 15 min to 1 h)
- To define the best delay of X min for your production context, you can use the Anton's script.
- Add ITSM Integration based on this alerting profile. 

## Best practices 

- Configure Maintenance Windows to disable the notification of the ITSM integration.  
For example, if you know that your application will not be used during Bank Hollidays, create a maintenance window to avoid the alert `Application Low Traffic`
You can do that easily with monaco template (example for [French banck hollidays](https://github.com/dynatrace-ace-services/quickstart-ace-configurator/tree/main/Maintenance-Window))

- Don't modify the thresholds (expecpt may be Disk threshold and specific needs in particular cases), but leave Davis to deal with his baseline  

- Create the SLO to take advantage of the real time Burn Rate alerte. 

## Feedback loop : SLO Quality of Service
Targeted or Consolidated ? 

- Targeted SLO = Specific SLO for main application or frontend service (as described above)  
- Consolidated SLO = filtered by MZ. You can use the Simply Smarter with the SLO smarters which have been configured globaly by  tenant and can be filtered by MZ : click [here](https://github.com/dynatrace-ace-services/slo-simply-smarter#readme)
